# Faster R-CNN with VGG16

This repository provides an implementation of Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) using the VGG16 architecture. Faster R-CNN is a popular object detection algorithm that combines deep learning with region proposal methods.
I have used three classes, Bed, Chair and Table.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Pandas

## Installation
## Tensorflow 
https://www.tensorflow.org/
## Open CV
## Keras

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/aliabbas30/Faster_Rcnn_Implemented.git

Use Model.py to get the functions of model
Step 1:


Create the dataset using Data preparation file, the link is given in the notebook for data downloading.


Step 2:


Define the model functions such as VGG 16 for feature extraction, RPN , ROI pooling layer and two fully connected layers. Same as in Model.py


Step 3:


Implement the whole model using those function as in main.ipnyb
